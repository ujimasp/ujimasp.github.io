<p>We focus on security and privacy topics that impact marginalized or historically ignored communities. Ujima is a Swahili word that is often translated as collective work and responsibility. We apply this principle to our research projects by working with end-users and experts from various disciplines to improve the security and privacy experiences of various communities.</p>
